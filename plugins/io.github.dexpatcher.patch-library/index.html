{"pluginId":"io.github.dexpatcher.patch-library","description":"DexPatcher is a toolchain for modifying Android applications at source-level using Java and the full power of Android Studio. The DexPatcher Patch Library plugin produces a DexPatcher patch library that bundles compiled changes to code, manifest and resources of a source application without bundling any part of the application itself. The source application is provided as an Android APK or a DexPatcher APK library. DexPatcher patch libraries are similar in structure to Android libraries (AAR files). The changes bundled in a patch library are applied to its source application using the DexPatcher Patched Application plugin. Several patch libraries can be applied in the same step or their application can be serialized and chained. DexPatcher is free software.
