# Gradle Plugin Portal API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gradle-plugins/portal-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gradle-plugins/portal-api)

This repository crawl the plugin portal in order to create a static REST API for everyone to use.
Feel free to help with the effort and contribute any change you feel the REST API should have.
Please note this REST API is a strictly vanilla API from plugins.gradle.org.

Future plan, under a different repository, will see an enhanced API with static analysis information of the plugins (e.g. security vulnerability, version supported, etc.) as well as user provided information (e.g. end of life of plugins, etc.).
