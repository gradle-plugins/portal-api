# [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/) API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gradle-plugins/portal-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gradle-plugins/portal-api)

This repository crawl the plugin portal to create a static REST API for everyone to use.
Feel free to help with the effort and contribute any change you feel the REST API should have.
Please note this REST API is a strictly vanilla API of https://plugins.gradle.org.

Future plan, will see an enhanced API with static analysis information of the plugins (e.g. security vulnerability, supported Gradle version, etc.) as well as user provided information (e.g. end of life of plugins, etc.).
